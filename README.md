# Emerging-Sys

The Milestone 3 project's objective is to blink two LEDs on a launchpad creating morse code of two messages. I designed a state machine that creates a pattern of blinking lights to create the morse code when a button is pressed. Each time a specific button is pressed the message changes and only changed to the other message when the first messages finishes. What I did particularly well is the state machine and understanding it to create a diagram of the state machine. Where I could improve is knowing when to implement functions and to understand better how to use those functions in the state machine. Skills from this project that would be particularly tranferable to other projects and\or coursework is the ability to create a state machine to be able to make the launchpad do specific things. I was able to make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable by keeping the code at a minimal without redundant code. Fixing errors and making sure that is runs and also to make sure that all requirements are met.
